# jvectormap-all-countries
A replacement for the world_mill map included with jVectorMap including all the missing tiny countries

Each tiny country is implemented as a circle without about the same diameter as the smallest countries included in the default map. The borders of existing regions were adjusted to accomodate any tiny countries inside the borders of another country.

## List of additional countries:

* Andorra
* Antigua and Barbuda
* Bahrain
* Barbados
* Cape Verde
* Comoros
* Dominica
* Grenada
* Kiribati
* Liechtenstein
* Maldives
* Malta
* Marshall Islands
* Mauritius
* Micronesia
* Monaco
* Nauru
* Palau
* Saint Kitts and Nevis
* Saint Lucia
* Saint Vincent and the Grenadines
* San Marino
* Sao Tome and Principe
* Seychelles
* Singapore
* Tonga
* Tuvalu
* Vatican City

## Other differences from the default map.
* The key for each country is not the ISO country code, but an arbitrary short string (sorry)
* French Guiana is a seperate region, and is not included as part of France (which it tehnically should be)
