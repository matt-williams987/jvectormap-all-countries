# jvectormap-all-countries
A replacement for the world_mill map included with jVectorMap including all the missing tiny countries

Each tiny country is implemented as a circle without about the same diameter as the smallest countries included in the default map. The borders of existing regions were adjusted to accomodate any tiny countries inside the borders of another country.

## List of additional countries:

Andorra
Antigua and Barbuda
Bahrain
Barbados
Cape Verde
Comoros
Dominica
Grenada
Kiribati
Liechtenstein
Maldives
Malta
Marshall Islands
Mauritius
Micronesia
Monaco
Nauru
Palau
Saint Kitts and Nevis
Saint Lucia
Saint Vincent and the Grenadines
San Marino
Sao Tome and Principe
Seychelles
Singapore
Tonga
Tuvalu
Vatican City

## Other differences from the default map.
* The key for each country is not the ISO country code, but an arbitrary short string (sorry)
* French Guiana is a seperate region, and is not included as part of France (which it tehnically should be)
